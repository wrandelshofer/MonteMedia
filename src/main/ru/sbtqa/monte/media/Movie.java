/**
 * A {@code movie} provides an editable container for media samples in a
 * time and tracks coordinate system.
 * 
 * <b>Note this interface is work in progress. It is not part of the API yet.</b>
 * 
 * A movie has a time dimension and a track dimension. The time dimension is
 * the duration of the movie. The track dimension is a list of tracks.
 * A track has a duration and a time offset.
 * 
 * 
 * Movie duration: |------------------------------------------------|
 * Track 0:         LOREMIPSUM
 * Track 1:         ..............THEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPSOVERTHELAZYDOG
 * Track 2:         .....FARFARAWAYBEHINDTHEMOUNTAINS
 * Track 3:         .......................THENIGHTWASHOTANDWET
 *    ... 
 * 
 * 
 * A track provides random access to decoded samples, either by index or
 * by a time offset.
 * 
 * Internally, a track consists of a media and a sequence of clips. 
 * The duration of a track is the sum of the duration of its clips.
 * 
 * A clips selects a contiguous sequence of samples from a media. It specifies a 
 * playback rate, and filters which are applied to the samples before
 * they are presented. The playback rate can be negative. 
 * The duration of a clip is the duration of the samples multiplied by its 
 * absolute playback rate.
 * 
 * A media is made up of a sequence of samples. It provides random access to
 * samples, either by index or by a time offset. Media provides decoding
 * information about the samples. Including a decoding sequence for predicted
 * samples. 
 * 
 * A sample provides encoded data for a specified duration. A sample is a
 * sequence of bytes located in a file at a specific offset and length.
